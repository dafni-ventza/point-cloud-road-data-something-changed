# point-cloud-road-data-something-changed
3D Geometry course, point cloud road data from two different years. 

Trying to cluster pairs of data regarding what changed between year 2016 and 2020. Aiming to a geometrical approach of solution.
1. Ground detection and deletion of the road
2. Clustering Euclidean conditional with and without KD-Trees
3. Registration
4. Cloud comparison
5. Classification

Point of interest is given in the datasets along with the following four labels:
1. Nochange
2. Added
3. Changed
4. Color_change
